# hello-world

Hi! My name is Jeff.

I'm new to this world of web development. Learning everyday is my goal. I've been a fan of technology since I was 7, when my
dad had me build one working computer from three that had problems with one piece or another. 

In high school I took several technology classes and found that I really like the web development portion of one of them. 
Alas, I did not latch on and follow that road though. I decided to try out lots, and lots, alots, a lots, (Lol) of other paths. 

It wasn't until about 2 months ago, when I finally got tired of doing things that I wasn;t passionate about, that I decided to sit down and figure out what it was that I wanted to do. Software development was the conclusion I came to. 

Right now I am learning the basics of HTML5/CSS3. Before long I hope to have a function personal website. I hope to meet lots of interesting people that will help shape me into a strong developer.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

-Jeff
